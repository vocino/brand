HEROES OF THE STORM
Powerful warriors from Azeroth, Sanctuary, the Koprulu sector, and beyond have been sucked into the Nexus, a transdimensional storm. Stranded in a strange limbo of clashing universes, these heroes have but one fate—endless battle for glory, survival, and just plain fun.

OVERWATCH
An international task force that maintained peace for a generation before it was shut down. Now in the wake of its dismantling, global conflict is rising. Overwatch may be gone… but the world still needs heroes.

STARCRAFT
As Artanis, Hierarch of the mighty protoss race, you are poised to reclaim your fallen homeworld—Aiur—from the zerg Swarm, but an ancient evil looms. Only you can unite your people and oppose the coming darkness before it consumes the galaxy.

HEARTHSTONE
Deceptively simple, yet insanely fun - welcome to Hearthstone, the free strategy card game for everyone. Play your cards to sling spells, summon creatures, and command the heroes of Warcraft to outwit your opponents in this game of awesome strategy!
